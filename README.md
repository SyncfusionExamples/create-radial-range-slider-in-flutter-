# Create Radial Range Slider in Flutter

In Flutter, we can easily create a range slider by customizing our Radial Gauge widget. The first step is to create the slider track and add labels in it. We can easily do this with minimum lines of code. Next, add the thumbs to the Radial Gauge along with the logic to handle the user dragging interactions. Now, the thumbs are on track and we have to update the color of the track bar between two thumbs. Now we update the pressure value based on the range selected. For that, use the annotations feature in the Flutter Radial Gauge widget.
